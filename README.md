# 2d Rally Extreme
This is a racing game. But it's not really a game yet. There's a menu though.

Update: this game is a semi-functional driving simulator. But it doesn't really simulate reality. It simulates whatever I made the variables to be in there because I don't actually know how reality works. Whoever designed this car should be fired. There is no actual racing functionality. More to come.
